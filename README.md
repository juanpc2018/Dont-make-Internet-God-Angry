All popular software and HW has a Kill Switch. </p>

Update severs will detect your IP, your on-line fingerprint,</br>
and send you tons of fake updates that will kill your OS. </br>
your VIA USB PCIe card. </p> 

like the movie Die Hard 4.0 (2007) is No joke, LOL.™ </br>
but PCs dont have C-4 inside, yet, LOL.™ </p>

its like the movie xXx (2002),
they want you to talk, but when you talk, they want you to shut up. LOL.™
